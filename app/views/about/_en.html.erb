          We made use of the broadcast feature of cable network to  achieve online meeting sytem. The system is capture the video and audio stream of moderator, and send multicast stream to our gateway servers, and then we forward the stream to cable network. I develop the gateway system , I used ruby to register the  stream node and assign the nodes one certification, then all the node can login and send stream.  I pack my ruby code to  gem , so it's easy to install

          The CableSpeedingSytem's purpose is to raise the bandwidth for users, the principle is that user connect our VPN server then our VPN can send the response packets to users by both PPPoE network and cable network. The system has 2 parts:  server side and terminal side, I developed the sevrer side by Ruby and C, I used EventMachine to serve user access requests and save sessions to memcache, and I write one C program to forward packets to Cable network, this is the core logic .  Additionally I developed network management in order to make load balance when forwarding.

          ASICS needs to manage 35 different country/language pairs, each with their own local contents, product databases, events, articles, store listings, and other region-specific information. To do this effectively they need decentralized control over website contents while maintaining centralized control of branding across all sites.
Additionally they require the ability to tie in easily with other APIs including Google Maps, Flickr, Twitter and the flexibility to quickly add new campaigns and features that are identified through real-world usage. I developed the core features as core member, I finished the CMS subsystem,  product subsystem, event subsystem and email subsystem by Rails, Additionally I use redis to improve the performence of secrch and use google api to show store map.
